However my present purpose is to choose my career to which I'll devote my whole life, so I must be very careful. Your company is one of the biggest companies in computer industry, and your company has a great future and advanced management system. As far as I know, your company requires highly qualified, conscientious and efficient staff, I think I am qualified to do your job.

A：我选择英特尔时只是考虑找一个专业对口的短期兼职职位，以便增加实践经验。现在我要选择的是将要终生从事的职业，所以我会非常慎重。 贵公司是计算机行业的龙头老大，有美好的发展前景和先进的管理制度。据我所知，贵公司要求员工有很强的责任心和很高的工作效率，我想我能胜任贵公司这份工作。

Firstly, I think I must know and adjust myself to the working situation, then learn from colleagues and gain work experience, finally become an excellent staff through surpassing others and myself.

A:成功不是单打独斗就能够实现的，与团队协作更容易取得成功，所以，在了解团 队的工作计划之前，就制定个人工作计 划是很不合适的。我想 我首先需要了解和适应公司的工作环境，然后向同事学习，积累经验，最后通过超越他人和自我，成为贵公司的优秀分子。
